          <div><p class="desc">Chicken is one of those meat items
         that finds its place in all Indian meals. A favorite among all age groups,
         chicken is not only easily available, but is also nutritious and healthy
         if consumed in right quantities.
         This lean meat can do wonders for all those non-vegetarians
         when consumed in a controllable manner.
         Implementing healthier food habits in our diets ensures a good body and better immunity.
         So here goes some of the numerous benefits of the delightful chicken!
              
         While chicken is a lean meat with loads of proteins, it is also high on cholesterol. 
         However, chicken provides selenium which contains antioxidants that help control free radicals
         and improve your immune system.

         A 100gms of cooked chicken would usually contain 239 calories. Of 100gms, 27gms would be only protein which is
         important for growth and development of various organs in the body. Besides, chicken also helps in maintaining
         the desired body weight. 
         Furthermore, it gives zinc and iron and is an excellent source for Vitamins B6, B12 and D.

          <div><p class="title">Beef</p></div>
          <div><p class="desc">Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus).

       It is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals,
       which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish.
       Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. 
       Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers.
       Processed beef products include corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages.
       Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. 
       Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be recommended as part of a healthy diet (1Trusted Source).

          <div><p class="title">Sushi</p></div>
          <div><p class="desc">Sushi is a dish enjoyed by people all over the world.
          It’s a Japanese staple that has been around for over 700 years (however,
          the version of sushi we know and love has only been around for 200 years).
          Though there are a seemingly endless number of variations, most sushi is often considered to have a number of surprising
          health benefits. At Nikko Japanese Restaurant & Sushi Bar, we have earned a reputation for serving up some of the best sushi in 
          Charlotte. In fact, we were voted by the “Best of Charlotte” as being the destination for “The Best Sushi Experience.”
          In today’s blog, we would like to share with you some of the health benefits of our favorite food—sushi.
          
          Sushi is known for having high amounts of concentrated forms of omega-3 fatty acids.
          This is perhaps the most sought after and cited benefit of sushi. These fatty acids act as a “good”
          form of cholesterol that helps to prevent clogged arteries. Omega-3 has also been linked to helping lower blood pressure.
          The types of sushi that are especially rich in omega-3 include lake trout, herring, tuna, and salmon.
